# I learned how to make a heading
## And a smaller heading
### And an even smaller heading

Some more things I learned:
* I learned how to make a bullet list
* [How to make an embeded hyperlink](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links)

I also learned how to make a numbered list:
1. **Item One is bolded**
2. *Item Two is Italicized*
3. ~~Item Three is crossed off~~
4. W<sub>o</sub>a<sup>h</sup> T<sup>h</sup>i<sub>s</sub> <sup>i</sup><sub>s</sub> w<sup>e<sup>i<sub>r</sub><sup>d</sup></sup></sup>
